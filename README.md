# OpenECG-XAI

OpenECG-XAI is an open-source dry-lab biomedical engineering project for classifying 12-lead ECG recordings as **normal** or **abnormal** using the **PTB-XL** dataset.

## Why this project exists

This project was built to make ECG machine learning more:

- accessible
- reproducible
- interpretable
- easy to extend

It is designed as a clean starting point for students, researchers, and developers interested in biomedical signal processing, health AI, and ECG classification.

## Current Version

Version 1 includes:

- PTB-XL metadata loading
- binary label generation (`normal` vs `abnormal`)
- ECG waveform loading
- single-lead and 12-lead ECG plotting
- basic feature extraction from all 12 leads
- baseline random forest classification
- confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- feature importance ranking
- saved metrics and result tables

## Project Goal

The current goal is to build an interpretable ECG classification pipeline that can distinguish between normal and abnormal ECG recordings using simple engineered features.

This baseline version is meant to be a strong foundation for later extensions into:

- broad abnormality category prediction
- MI vs STTC vs CD vs HYP classification
- finer diagnosis-level prediction
- stronger explainability methods

## Dataset

This project uses the **PTB-XL** public 12-lead ECG dataset.

For the baseline version, the **100 Hz waveform files** are used.

Expected dataset location:

```text
data/raw/ptbxl/

## Who this is for

This repo is useful for:

- students learning biomedical machine learning
- people learning ECG signal analysis
- beginner health-AI developers
- anyone wanting a PTB-XL starter pipeline

## How to Run

### 1. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Add the PTB-XL dataset
Put the dataset here:

```text
data/raw/ptbxl/
